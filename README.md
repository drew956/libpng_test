This is a little test repo for some C code for creating pngs using libpng.
The basic template from the initial commit is from: <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-s096-introduction-to-c-and-c-january-iap-2013/pages/final-project/starter-kit/">MIT Opencourseware page"</a>.

Eventually I plan on doing a larger project, as outlined on this page here:
<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-s096-introduction-to-c-and-c-january-iap-2013/pages/final-project/">Final Project Ideas</a>
I plan on writing a lot of C and C++ code over the next week and uploading it here, as most of the code I write is not on github.
